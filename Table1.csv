"Footnotes for Table 1.
1.      NS, not specified; AUC, area under the curve.  Serving sizes in grams unless otherwise specified.
2.     Mean � SEM. Two GI values are shown for each food � one in which glucose sugar was used as the reference food and one in which white bread was used as the reference food.
3.      Estimated by multiplying the food�s listed GI value with glucose as the reference food by the listed g carbohydrate per serving and dividing by 100.

6.      International Diabetes Institute (Melbourne, Australia), unpublished observations, 2006 � 2007.
7.      Portions of the test food and the reference food contained 10 g carbohydrate.
8.      Portions of the test food and the reference food contained 25 g carbohydrate.
9.      GI calculated from the 120 min AUC data included in the original article using the AUC food/AUC reference food formula.

12.   GI calculated by using a mathematical formula based on results from an in vitro starch hydrolysis assay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13.   White rice was used as the reference food, but glucose was also tested and had a GI of 122.  The observed GI was multiplied by 100 and then divided by 122 to convert it to a GI on the glucose scale (ie, glucose = reference food with a GI of 100).
14.   Portions of the test food and the reference food contained 75 g carbohydrate.
15.   Portions of the test food and the reference food contained 100 g carbohydrate.

26.   Potato used as the reference food with a GI fixed at 80.  The GI of the test food was calculated by expressing the test food�s glucose AUC value as a percentage of the potato�s AUC value.
27.   GI calculated from the 90 min AUC data included in the original article using the AUC food/AUC reference food formula.
28.   GI calculated from the 150 min AUC data included in the original article using the AUC food/AUC reference food formula.
